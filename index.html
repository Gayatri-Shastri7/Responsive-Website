        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, eating healthy food 
        remains an important part of maintaining your health. While there are no specific foods that can 
        help protect you from the virus, a nutritious diet can boost your immune system or help you fight
         off symptoms. You may not be able to share meals with friends and loved ones, 
        but there are lots of other ways to eat well and support your health at this difficult time.</p> </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">What is a healthy diet?</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations,
            staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s
            about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">The fundamentals of healthy eating</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Protein gives you the energy to get up and go—and 
            keep going—while also supporting mood and cognitive function. Too much protein can 
            be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the latest research suggests that many 
            of us need more high-quality protein, especially as we age. 
            
                Fat. Not all fat is the same. While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase 
                your risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart. 
            
            
                Fiber. Eating foods high in dietary fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and beans)
                 can help you stay regular and lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. 
            
            
                Calcium. As well as leading to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your diet
                 can also contribute to anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. 
            
            
                Carbohydrates are one of your body’s main sources of energy. But most should come from complex, 
                unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains, fruit) rather than sugars and refined carbs.
            </p>
        
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> 
            Switching to a healthy diet doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition. You don’t have to be
            perfect, you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don’t have to change 
            everything all at once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan.
